**Countr** is a counting bot and can be set up in 3 simple steps.
1. Add the bot using [this](https://discordapp.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=467377486141980682&permissions=11280&scope=bot) link. The bot requires these permissions to function correctly.
2. Make a channel (for example #counting-channel)
3. Type `c!channel` in the channel you created

That's it!

<big>Troubleshooting</big>

We also have a troubleshoot-command, `c!troubleshoot`, that tells you what's wrong with the bot. If there still are issues with the bot, please join the support server and ask for help.

<big>Keep in mind!</big>

- To avoid spam of the bot and the channel, you can only send a number after someone else has.
- You can reset the counter with `c!reset`.
- The only information we store in our systems are:
	- The counting channel ID
	- How many counts in that channel
	- The user ID of the last count in that channel
	- Global counts
